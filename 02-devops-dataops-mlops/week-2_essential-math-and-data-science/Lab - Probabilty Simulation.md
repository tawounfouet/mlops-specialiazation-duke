# Overview

In this lab, you will explore using probability simulations to model real-world scenarios, such as startup careers and roulette wheel outcomes. You will run the startup.py simulator and the roulette.py simulator better to understand the concept of probability and its applications.

## Goals

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Understand the importance of simulations in modeling real-world scenarios.

- Learn how to simulate career earnings and investor portfolios.

- Explore patterns in roulette wheel spins and make informed decisions based on probability.


## Getting Started

A. Simulate a career earnings vs investor portfolio

- Run the startup.py simulator and explore how each command works.
 `./startup.py`

- Usage: startup_game.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

- Startup Game Simulator
`Options: --help Show this message and exit`

- `Commands`: sanity Sanity test the simulation with a small number of... simulate Simulate a startup career simulate_multiple Simulate a startup career for multiple people vcportfolio Simulate a venture capitalist investing in a...

- Create your own VC portfolio using vcportfolio and startup career using simulate_multiple.

- Reflection question: What did you learn about the payoff for a regular employee vs. an investor?

- Reflection question: Why are simulations important first modeling steps?


B. Determine if roulette wheels have patterns that a simulation can determine

Run the following command:

./roulette.py spin --count 10 --color red --bet 1

Reflection question: Is it wise to bet a large bet on red if you see the roulette wheel hit 10 black numbers in a row?

Reflection question: Is there any behavior you could add to the roulette simulator that would improve it? If so, do it and build a portfolio project that shows your enhancement.
