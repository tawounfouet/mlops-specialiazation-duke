## Play Poker

### Setup
cd into `/home/coder/project` and run `source /home/coder/venv/bin/activate`

### Instructions

Your goal is to learn to build real-world simulations using command-line tools. 
If you run the ```--help``` option you will see the follow methods available.

```
(.venv) @noahgift ➜ /workspaces/Coursera-MLOPs-Foundations-Lab-2-poker-simulator (main ✗) $ ./poker.py 
Usage: poker.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A poker hand simulator

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  deal         Deal a hand of cards
  info         Displays all possible winning hands with examples
  interactive  Play a hand of poker against the computer with a bet
  play         Play a hand of poker against the computer with a bet
```

### Tasks

1. Investigate tool operation:

* Run each of the four commands with `--help` i.e. `poker.py info --help`.
* Reflection Question:  What did you learn about how to construct help commands for simulation tools?

2. Explore the `interactive` commands and create a list of five improvements you could make to the interactive simulation to make it more realistic.  

(Optional:  Fork this repository and make your own improved version of the Poker simulator)
