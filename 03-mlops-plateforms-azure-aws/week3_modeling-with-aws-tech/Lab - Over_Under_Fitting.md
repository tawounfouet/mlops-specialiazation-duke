# Underfitting vs Overfitting


## Lab Goal
Experiment with model complexity to recognize underfitting and overfitting

## Lab Description
In this hands-on lab, you will train linear and polynomial regression models on synthetic data. By tweaking model complexity and visualizing fit, you will develop intuition for underfitting, proper fitting, and overfitting.

## Lab Steps
1. Generate nonlinear synthetic 1D data
2. Train simple linear model
3. Plot model predictions to assess underfit
4. Train complex 7th degree polynomial model
5. Plot model predictions to assess overfit
6. Try models with complexity between linear and 7th degree polynomial


## Reflection Questions
1. What visual cues indicate a model is underfit or overfit?
2. What risks arise from a severely overfit model in production?
3. Why evaluate both training and validation performance?
4. How can synthetic data augment real data when assessing model fit?
5. What real-world scenarios might exhibit overfitting or underfitting?


## Challenge Exercises
1. Try different feature transformations like polynomials, sinusoids etc.
2. Explore regularization techniques to reduce overfitting like LASSO.
3. Generate higher-dimensional synthetic data.
4. Implement k-fold cross validation evaluation.
5. Research techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.
