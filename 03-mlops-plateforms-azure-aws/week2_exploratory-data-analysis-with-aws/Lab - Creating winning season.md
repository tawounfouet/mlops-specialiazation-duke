# Feature Engineering-Creating a Winning Season

- `Lab Goal`: Apply feature engineering techniques to classify winning and losing NBA team seasons using player statistics.

- `Lab Description`: Use a dataset of NBA player data to engineer features that can help train a model to predict whether a team's season record will be a winning or losing one.


## Lab Steps:

- Import NBA player dataset
- Explore data distributions with visualizations
- Create winning_season feature using total wins threshold
- Select key features like age, points, salary
- Handle missing data and preprocess features
- Train classification model on engineered dataset
- Evaluate model accuracy on test set


## Reflection Questions
- Which feature provided the most predictive signal?
- How does feature scaling impact model performance?
- What data would you collect to improve predictions?
- How would you handle imbalanced winning/losing seasons?
- Where would you deploy this to make real predictions?


## Challenge Exercises
- Engineer new features using player statistics
- Handle missing data without dropping rows
- Compare models like Random Forest and SVM
- Improve model with tuning and cross-validation
- Set up web interface allowing user feature input
