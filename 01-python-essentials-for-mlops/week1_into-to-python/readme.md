# Week 1 - Introduction to Python 

In this module, you will learn how to effectively use `variables`, `logic`, and Pythonâ€™s `data structures` to load, persist, and iterate over data. You will apply these data structures to solve different problems as well as extract data from them.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn Python Data Structures
- Learn variables and types
- Apply different Python data structures to work with data
- Use conditional logic and loops to extract data
- Assign variables and retrieve values from data structures
