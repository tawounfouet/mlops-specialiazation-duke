# Hugging Face and ONNX

ðŸ¤— Hugging Face and ONNX
Learn how to port popular models to the ONNX format.

For this lab you will use GitHub repository `https://github.com/alfredodeza/huggingface-onnx` with Codespaces which has all dependencies ready for you to interact with the examples Jupyter Notebooks. Optionally,  clone the repository and set up the environment yourself.

## Exercise
1. Use a different model to port over to Hugging Face
2. Try a specific feature for a different model
3. Load the resulting ONNX model with the ONNX Runtime and try using it
